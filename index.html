    <h2>What is self care?</h2>
        <p>Self-care is the intentional practice of nurturing your physical, mental,
            and emotional health. For busy professionals in computing jobs and anyone 
            who spends long hours in front of screens, it means setting healthy boundaries, 
            taking regular breaks, and adopting habits that help prevent
            burnout and improve well-being. There is so much more to life than screens
            and doomscrolling, so remember to take care of yourself.
