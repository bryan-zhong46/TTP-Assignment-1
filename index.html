            <h2>What is self care?</h2>
             <p>Self-care is the intentional practice of nurturing your physical, mental,
                and emotional health. For busy professionals in computing jobs and anyone 
                who spends long hours in front of screens, it means setting healthy boundaries, 
                taking regular breaks, and adopting habits that help prevent
                burnout and improve well-being. There is more to life than screens and doomscrolling.
                 Let us help each other rediscover it.

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>We were not built for nonstop input. Yet many of us spend 8 to 12 hours a day staring at screens either working, 
                studying, or just scrolling. Over time, this constant stimulation takes a toll on our minds and bodies.
                For people with full schedules, endless notifications, and constant screen time, slowing down can feel 
                impossible. But the longer we go without pausing, the more we pay the price
            </p>
            <h3>Mental Effects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety: Constant demands and digital overload can heighten anxiety and make it harder to calm down.</li>
                <li>Depression: Lack of rest and persistent stress can contribute to depressive symptoms over time.</li>
                <li>Irritability: Stress reduces emotional regulation, leading to mood swings and frustration.</li>
                <li>Focus & Concentration: Multitasking and mental fatigue reduce your ability to focus or stay present.</li>
                <li>Memory: Chronic stress impairs memory formation and recall, especially in high-pressure environments.</li>
                

            </ul>
            <h3>Physical Effects</h3>

                <li>Fatigue: Mental stress and screen overstimulation can leave you physically and mentally drained.</li>

                You can't pour from an empty cup, and you don't have to earn rest. 
                Even short, intentional breaks can help you reset, reduce stress, and reconnect with yourself.
